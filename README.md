    * Modified the message sync procedure to download and update the existing messages instead of downloading only new messages.
    * Fixed error during an account deletion.

# Setting up the environment.
- Install Visual Studio 2015 Community. Make sure you install the components to develop C# WPF Application. This might be installed by default. If they are not installed initially, you will have an option to install them later when you open the project.
- Double-click the .sln file to open the project.
